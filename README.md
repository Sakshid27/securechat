IDE: Apache NetBeans

Networking: Java Sockets

Encryption: AES (Advanced Encryption Standard)

Build and run the application.

Ensure both sender and receiver have the application running for communication.

📖 How It Works
The server initializes and waits for client connections.

The client connects to the server and sends encrypted messages.

Messages are decrypted at the receiver’s end for secure communication.

🚀 Future Enhancements
